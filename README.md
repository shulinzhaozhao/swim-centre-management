# Swim Centre Management System 

This group project was a collaborative effort undertaken by myself, @fangxin-tang, @dorachenxiW, @nayxie, and @SimonEccleston over a span of 4 weeks from August to September, 2023. It served as an assessment for the COMP639 Studio Project at Lincoln University. 

The project entailed the development of a `full-stack web application` that utilises `Python and Flask` for the backend, `Jinja` templating, `HTML`, `Bootstrap`, `CSS`, and `JavaScript` for the frontend, along with a `MySQL` database.
